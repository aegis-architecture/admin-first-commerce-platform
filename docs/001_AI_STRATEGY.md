# AI Integration Strategy

## Core Philosophy

**AI enhances clarity. AI never controls outcomes.**

### Three Immutable Principles

1. **Admin Authority is Final**: Every AI suggestion requires explicit human approval
2. **Deterministic Commerce**: Payments and order processing remain independent of AI
3. **Graceful Degradation**: System operates at full capacity if AI is unavailable

## Version 1: Infrastructure (Q1-Q2 2026)

**Status**: Infrastructure Ready, Behavior Disabled

- AI advisory domain architecture complete
- Configuration model established
- Safety boundaries enforced
- No active AI behavior
- Full commerce independence validated

## Version 2: Intelligence Activation (Q3-Q4 2026)

**Goals**: Enable AI advisory with approval gates

### Features

- **Content Clarity**: Suggestions for clearer content
- **SEO Optimization**: Keyword and structure suggestions
- **Ambiguity Detection**: Flag unclear content
- **Format Normalization**: Consistency recommendations

### Requirements

- Every suggestion requires explicit approval
- Complete audit logging
- Confidence scores on all suggestions
- Reasoning for each recommendation

## What AI Will NEVER Do

**❌ Transaction Operations**
- Modify payment records
- Create undefined order states
- Execute refunds
- Change customer data

**❌ Operational Autonomy**
- Publish content automatically
- Activate integrations
- Change prices
- Reorder inventory
- Send emails
- Modify navigation

**❌ Administrative Bypass**
- Override admin authority
- Execute without approval
- Access raw system files
- Modify security settings

## Data Governance

### AI CAN Access
- Public product information
- Admin-created content
- Anonymized usage patterns
- Aggregate sales trends

### AI CANNOT Access
- Customer payment information
- Raw customer identities
- Internal security settings
- Database credentials

## Failure Modes

**AI Service Unavailable**
- System continues at full capacity
- Admin notified
- No fallback behavior
- Graceful degradation

**Poor Quality Suggestions**
- Admin can disable by feature
- Historical accuracy tracked
- Model retraining triggered

## Long-Term Vision (2028+)

**Potential Capabilities**:
- Autonomous agent layer with approval
- Predictive personalization (advisory)
- Omnichannel integration
- Advanced BI and forecasting

**Principles Remain Unchanged**:
- Admin authority is supreme
- Commerce determinism non-negotiable
- Safety over features
- Graceful degradation mandatory
